<h2>GETTING TO KNOWE ME MORE</h2>
	
		<p>I like to play mobile and computer games such as ml, codm valo etc. this is often my hobby when I finish my work at home and acads. I also rarely go out of the house. I only go out of the house when I really need to or go to the gym or go biking with my friends. I prefer to stay at home to save money. I also want to do a lot of things outside like climbing hiking. travel to popular places close to our area</p>

		<p>I want to be a front end developer or full stack developer in the future because I know the demand is high especially nowadays that people are using computers to make things easier for them. and based on what I have researched, this is one of the stable jobs in the future. I will go through many and difficult things, but I am willing to do my best to expand my knowledge and skills in doing these things. If I I will be lucky to finish this course, this is my biggest goal to get, but for now what I have done is more on self study so that I can have at least an idea of the things I want to do. I am also looking at websites on how they layout the websites they are working on.</p>


		<p>I stopped 2 years before the pandemic due to financial problems and I don't really like the online class. I used to study at WCC. If I didn't stop studying, I am now one of the full 4th year students, but the focus is also is a game development when I first entered this course I really had no idea because what I took for SHS was food processing so I took it because I preferred to be practical where there is something closer and I won't have to spend a lot of money every day .I know myself that there will come a point where I will have a hard time because the things I took in school and in college are different, but I'm just saying in my mind that there is no easy way to get to the job I want, everything I go through will not be easy, what I need is to be patient and trust myself that I can do it and just pray to the Lord to guide me in the things I will do and walk in college life</p>

		<p>I wasted a lot of opportunities in my past decisions in life but now I want to make up and prove that even though I made mistakes in what I did before I prove that I can take myself back and prove to myself that I can do this thing I have many dreams for me and my family, especially my parents. I want to give back to them the sacrifices they made so that we can be siblings. I want in the near future to be the one to give them things that they can't buy. they put our needs first, this is one of my motivations so I don't give up on what I'm doing. I still have a lot to prove to myself. It's not in my plan to have a family. What I want now is to make up for my parents for everything they've done. them since our childhood. I tell myself that in the future we don't need to look at our budget while shopping that we won't have money problems anymore. all the hard work has a good thing in return, all the perseverance to do something will give grace, just don't forget to pray and thank the Lord for all the blessings that will be received in any way

<h2>What I see myself after 5 or 10 years? </h2>
		<p>I envision myself working as a front end developer in a company in five to ten years, having a good job, and raising a family. If I make it to that point, I'll be proud of myself for not giving up on the thing that will give me a good life, and I'll give thanks to the Lord because he is the primary reason I'll get it soon.</p>
